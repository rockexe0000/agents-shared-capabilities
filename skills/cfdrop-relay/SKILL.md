# cfdrop-relay — Auto-open Deploys on a Paired Viewer

Extends the `cfdrop` skill: after a successful deploy, `--notify` (cfdrop ≥0.6.1)
pushes the live URL to a relay server, and any viewer device paired with that relay
opens the site immediately. The relay server and viewer app live in the
`cfdrop-app` repo.

## Prerequisites

- `cfdrop` ≥0.6.1 (`cfdrop --version`)
- A running cfdrop relay (default port 8788) reachable from this machine — referred
  to below as `relay-host`
- The relay token, stored on the relay host at `~/.cfdrop-relay-token`

## Usage

```bash
export CFDROP_NOTIFY=http://relay-host:8788   # relay endpoint
export CFDROP_RELAY_TOKEN=$(ssh relay-host 'cat ~/.cfdrop-relay-token')

cfdrop deploy --directory /tmp/<slug>-site --name <slug> -y --notify
```

Everything else (site generation, mobile design rules, verification) follows the
base `cfdrop` skill — `--notify` is purely additive.

## Behavior

1. cfdrop deploys as usual and prints the live URL.
2. It warms up the site first (probes `<url>/?cfdrop-warmup=N` with retries) so the
   viewer doesn't land on a cold edge cache.
3. It POSTs the URL to `${CFDROP_NOTIFY}/push` with the token in an
   `x-relay-token` header.
4. On success it prints `Pushed URL to relay at <endpoint>.`

## Failure modes

- **Notify failure never fails the deploy** — the site is live either way; cfdrop
  prints `warning: relay notify failed: ...` and exits 0. Re-share the URL manually.
- `CFDROP_NOTIFY must be set for --notify` — export the relay endpoint (see Usage).
- `CFDROP_RELAY_TOKEN must be set for --notify` — export the token (see Usage).
- `relay returned 401/403` — token mismatch; re-read it from
  `relay-host:~/.cfdrop-relay-token`.
- `warning: site not reachable yet, skipping notify` — warm-up probes never got a
  200; the URL is still printed, push it again once the site responds (redeploying
  with `--notify` is idempotent).
- Connection refused — relay not running on `relay-host`, or wrong `CFDROP_NOTIFY`.
